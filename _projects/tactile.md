Our tactile visualization was a chance for our team to create a hands-on, physical representation of our corpus data. For this project, we created map of the united states etched on to a piece of plywood that indicated the specific states and countries, where students from the time period of 1931-1949 hailed from. 

We began this process by searching corpus text files for commencement issues that had graduating students names and where they're from. We were then able create new text files for each of the 26 issues so files only had the section(s) with graduating students names and where they're from. After cleaning the data in open refine,  we were able to find students from 48 states and 36 countries outside of the United States. 


Once we found the data we were able to get started making the physical representation. We began preparing the plywood, etching the map of the United States, and then For each of the 48 states and 36 countries represented, we drilled a place for one LED. Each LED  is represented on a scale of 5 colors, which indicate the amount of students from that particular state, or country. For example: A blue LED indicates 1 to 10 mentions of students from a particular state/country, whereas a Pink LED includes 101 to 500 mentions. The colors were chosen in order to be as accessible as possible.
