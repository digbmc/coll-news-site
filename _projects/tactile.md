Creating a physical representation of data allowed our team to step away from our laptops and engage in hands-on critical making. For the project, we carved a map of the United States onto a piece of plywood and used a wood burning tool to etch five shapes that represent concentrations of graduated students from each state between 1931 and 1949. Each shape is painted a different color for accessibility and aesthetic purposes.

We prepared for the project by searching corpus text files for commencement issues that included graduating students' names and where they are from. We were then able create new text files for each of the 26 issues so files only had these two section(s). After cleaning the data in [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/),  we were able to find students from 47 states (plus Washington D.C.) and 34 other countries and territories.

Once we gathered the data, we were able to break ground on the tactile visualization. We prepared the plywood, printed out segments of the U.S. states to trace onto carbon paper that was aligned with the plywood, carefully carved an outline of the states, wood burned five distinct shapes onto the wood, and painted them with acrylics.

Our key includes five shapes, which have their own distinct color and indicate the number of students from that particular state. For example...
