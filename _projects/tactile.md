Our tactile visualization was a chance for our team to create a hands-on, physical representation of our corpus data. For this project, we carved a map of the United States onto a piece of plywood indicating the specific states and countries which Bryn Mawr graduates from the time period of 1931-1949 hailed from. 

We began this process by searching corpus text files for commencement issues that had graduating students' names and where they're from. We were then able create new text files for each of the 26 issues so files only had the section(s) with graduating students' names and where they're from. After cleaning the data in OpenRefine,  we were able to find students from 48 states and 36 countries outside of the United States. 


Once we found the data we were able to get started making the physical representation. We began preparing the plywood, tracing the map onto the wood with carbon paper, carving the map of the United States, and then drilling a hole for an LED for each of the 48 states and 36 countries represented. Each LED is represented on a scale of 5 colors, which indicate the amount of students from that particular location. For example: a blue LED indicates 1 to 10 mentions of students from a particular location, whereas a pink LED represents 101 to 500 mentions. The colors were chosen in order to be as accessible as possible.
