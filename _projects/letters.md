Nearly every issue of *The College News* had a handful of Letters to the Editor written by Bryn Mawr students, faculty, staff, or even readers not in the campus community. These letters provide a glimpse into life at the time of publication as their topics range from niche campus controversies to global affairs.

The Letters to the Editor project fulfilled a desire to focus on a unique section of the large *College News* corpus. By reading letters from issues in the 1960s and creating metadata, the fellows were able to see how readers engaged with *The College News* during an eventful decade.

Metadata for each letter includes its writer, their affiliation (student, faculty, staff, etc.), and topic. Library of Congress Subject Headings, a standardized list of cataloging terms, were used to categorize letter topics. Additionally, a text file was assembled for each letter so its content could be easily accessed and studied. All metadata and text files will be available on the *College News* project [Github](https://github.com/digbmc/college-news/tree/main/letters-to-editor).
