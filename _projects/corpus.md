Our corpus is a structured data set that includes every issue from the [Bryn Mawr College News](https://digitalcollections.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/collections/bryn-mawr-college-news). The College News ran from 1914-1968 before becoming what is now known as the [Bi-Co News](https://bicollegenews.com). This newspaper ran weekly (except on national holidays) and is compromised of 1,340 issues. Our team used the BeautifulSoup Python library to scrape the metadata to create a text file for each issue, allowing anyone who used our code to have access to text files of all 1,340 issues on their downloaded onto their computers. 

This work was made possible by a 2012 Special Collections project, which digitized the college's newspaper issues and yearbooks. The project was done under the umbrella of Albert M. Greenfield Digital Center for the History of Women's Education which operated as part of Special Collections from 2010 to 2016. The transcriptions of the College News issues used to produce the corpus were created by processing high-resolution TIFF files of digitized microfilm using the optical character recognition [(OCR)](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/definition/OCR-optical-character-recognition) program [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
