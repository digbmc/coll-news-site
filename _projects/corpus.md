Our team has spent the summer working with the [Bryn Mawr College News](https://digitalcollections.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/collections/bryn-mawr-college-news). The student-run newspaper was published weekly (except on national holidays) during the academic year from 1914 to 1968. It merged with the *Haverford News* in 1968 to form the *[Bi-College News](https://bicollegenews.com)*, which is still active today.

In 2012, as part of a Bryn Mawr Special Collections project, *The College News* was digitized from microfilm into high-resolution TIFF files. Years later in early 2021, the files were processed with the optical character recognition [(OCR)](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/definition/OCR-optical-character-recognition) program [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to transcribe each of the newspaper's 1,340 issues. These transcripts were the basis of our work.
