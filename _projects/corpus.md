Our corpus is a [structured data set](https://github.com/digbmc/college-news/tree/main/data) that includes every issue from the College News, which ran from 1914-1968. Our team then used the BeautifulSoup program to create a text file for each issue, which each team member was able to work with for our team visualizations as well as our individual visualizations. This work was made possible by a 2012 Special Collections and Internet Archive project that digitized the college's newspaper issues and yearbooks. The transcriptions of the College News issues used to produce the corpus were created by processing high-resolution TIFF files of digitized microfilm using the optical character recognition (OCR) program [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
