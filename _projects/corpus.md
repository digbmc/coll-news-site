Our team has spent the summer working with every issue published by the [Bryn Mawr College News](https://digitalcollections.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/collections/bryn-mawr-college-news). The newspaper ran weekly (except on national holidays) from 1914 to 1968 and published 1,340 issues. After 1968, the College News transformed into what is now known as the [Bi-College News](https://bicollegenews.com), a joint publication with Haverford College.

In 2012, as part of a Bryn Mawr Special Collections project, the College News was digitized from microfilm into high-resolution TIFF files. Years later, in early 2021, these files were processed with the optical character recognition [(OCR)](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/definition/OCR-optical-character-recognition) program [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to create... (something with transcript and issue(s))

To explore our code, visit our [Github repository](https://github.com/digbmc/college-news) or check out the [Tri-College Libraries Digital Collections](https://digitalcollections.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/collections/bryn-mawr-college-news) to browse issues.
