My interest in Bryn Mawr students' global awareness and involvement was ignited while perusing issues of the corpus written during World War I. I noticed that the tone and scope of focus was quite different from more carefree, campus-centered periods of peace — and decided to embark on a more expansive research project documenting mentions of place names in issues during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War up to 1968.

While Bryn Mawr College’s social world is often percieved as an insulated bubble, the College News wartime issues makes it abundantly clear that Bryn Mawr’s student body was comprised of engaged global citizens who delegated attention not only to pressing campus issues but broader concerns as well. However, considering that Bryn Mawr is an institution that has historically placed an emphasis on Western interests, I surmised that students’ focus during periods of war and conflict would be primarily directed towards Europe and North America. In order to explore my hypothesis, I used a topic modeling tool to identify geopolitical entities (GPEs) and created a Google MyMaps visualization using the CSV data.

Visitors can add or remove map layers by selecting the checkboxes in the panel to the left. Clicking on the map's pins will reveal the newspaper issue the location is in and its number of appearances in the issue.
