Visitors can add or remove map layers by selecting the checkboxes in the panel to the left. Clicking on the map's pins will reveal the newspaper issue the location is in and its number of appearances in the issue. 

Confused by the labels? GPE_clean represents words that underwent data cleaning — meaning that incorrectly spelled, formatted, incomplete, or duplicate place names have been fixed or removed. The widget header that appears when a location is selected represents a College News issue in the following format: "cn year-month-day.txt".

My interest in Bryn Mawr students' geopolitical awareness was ignited while perusing issues of the corpus written during World War I. I noticed that the tone and scope of focus were quite different from issues published during more carefree, campus-oriented periods of peace — and decided to embark on a more expansive mapping project that depicts international place names in issues published during World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War up to 1968.

To bring this visualization to life, I used a topic modeling tool to identify geopolitical entities (GPEs). I then used the CSV file that was produced to build a Google MyMaps visualization. 

While my intention is to leave this data and its accompanying visualization up for individual interpretation, the College News wartime issues seem to reveal that Bryn Mawr's student body was largely comprised of engaged global citizens who delegated attention not only to pressing campus issues — but to salient political concerns that reached beyond the scope of the College as well.
