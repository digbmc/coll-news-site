While Bryn Mawr College’s social world seems to resemble an insulated bubble, the College News corpus from 1914-1968 makes it abundantly clear that Bryn Mawr’s student body was largely comprised of engaged global citizens who delegated attention not only to pressing campus issues but broader concerns as well. However, considering that Bryn Mawr is an institution that has historically placed an emphasis on Western interests, I surmised that students’ attention during periods of war and conflict would be primarily focused on Europe and North America. In order to explore my hypothesis, I used a topic modeling tool to identify geopolitical entities (GPEs) and created a map visualization using the CSV data.

Visitors can add or remove map layers by selecting the checkboxes in the panel to the left. Clicking on the map's pins will reveal the newspaper issue the location appears in and its number of appearances in the issue.
