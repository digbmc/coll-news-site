This project originally began with an intention to highlight the voices of South Asian Students in Bryn Mawr College. However, upon developing this project, I discovered that there were little to no mentions of the stories of South Asian Bryn Mawr students. In fact, the mentions of South Asia were almost entirely mentions of Therefore, I decided to present the data of two countries in South Asia (India and Pakistan) and the two largest religious groups in South Asia (Hindus and Muslims). 


The data for the visualization was retrieved through a [multiple keyword context search script](https://github.com/digbmc/college-news/blob/main/text-mining/keyword-context-chunks-tm.py). Using this code, I was able to pull every mention of the words “India, Pakistan, Muslim, and Hindu” along with a 200 character context to each mention from the corpus by issue date and year. I then used Altair to create my final data visualization.  I used the strip plot graph within the Altair library and added tool tips to include the context behind the mention of the specific word in the context.  Finally, I used the converted it to an HTML and uploaded it to the site.

One can use this visualization by hovering their cursor over a specific term and bar year, where they can then see the exact name of the issue and a bit of context behind the passage where the keyword was mentioned. This is particularly helpful for those who would like to see how each of these terms were represented in Bryn Mawr College News in that particular time period.
