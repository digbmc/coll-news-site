<div id="vis"></div>

This graph shows how frequently different religions were mentioned in the College News corpus. Protestant Christianity was excluded because Bryn Mawr College was founded as a Protestant Christian (specifically, Quaker) institution and this project aimed to bring attention onto other religious groups.

The motivation for this project was a desire to know more about religious diversity in the history of Bryn Mawr. While I quickly realized that I would not be able to get a huge amount of information about different religious practices at Bryn Mawr in the early 20th century, I was still able to explore attitudes toward religion and ways that students were engaging with religion on campus and through the College News. 

The data for this visualization was acquired through a combination of keyword searching and topic modeling. I identified potential keywords by uploading the corpus into [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org). I used a [list of religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religions_and_spiritual_traditions) to search in Voyant’s existing frequency visualization tool, noting each search that was getting results. I performed a keyword search to identify instances where religions were mentioned in the corpus and extracted the 250 characters surrounding each keyword as context. 

I used the [Topic Modeling Tool](https://github.com/senderle/topic-modeling-tool) to generate topic data for each context chunk and added the most relevant topic for that instance to my dataset. Then, I aggregated data by year and identified the most frequent topic for each religion in each year. Finally, I used [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) to display the data. I modeled my chart after the “Natural Disasters” visualization from the [Altair example gallery](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/natural_disasters.html) and added tooltips to show the specific numbers as well as the topic data for each point. I exported the chart as a JSON object and then embedded it in the site using [Vega](https://vega.github.io).
