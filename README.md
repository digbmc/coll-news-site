# Instructions for Editing

This site template uses the Agency Jekyll Theme: https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme. This repository includes the basic files for that template. Basic content customization can be done by changing text, images, and options already present in these files, and by adding files that follow the structure used by the [Agency theme repository](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme).

You can view the site at: https://digbmc.github.io/coll-news-site/ - if you make changes it may take a few minutes to rebuild the site.

NB: if you wish to preview changes on your local computer, you can do so by cloning or downloading this repository and installing and running Jekyll using [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

To learn more about Jekyll, see the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
